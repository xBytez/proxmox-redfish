## Prerequisites

- Proxmox VE 7.0 or higher
- A Linux host or container with network access to the Proxmox API
- Credentials with permission to manage the target VMs and upload ISOs to the selected Proxmox storage
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

## System Requirements

- **Proxmox VE**: 7.0 or higher
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: 512MB RAM minimum
- **Storage**: 100MB free space
- **Network**: HTTP/HTTPS access to Proxmox API

## Quick Start Guide

This guide will take you from a fresh install to a working Redfish API daemon. The daemon can run on the Proxmox node or on a separate host, as long as it can reach the Proxmox API and the source ISO URLs you plan to use.


### Installation

1. Make sure to upgrade your system before beginning. **Open a web browser** and navigate to your Proxmox web interface:

   ```bash
   https://your-proxmox-ip:8006
   ```

2. Navigate to **Datacenter** > **YOUR-HYPERVISOR-HOSTNAME** > **Updates**, and click on **Refresh** to update your that host's packages.

3. Open a shell on the machine where you want to run the daemon. This can be the Proxmox node, but it does not need to be.

   ```bash
   ssh your-user@YOUR-DAEMON-HOSTNAME
   ```

4. Install Python and Dependencies

   ```bash
   # Update the system
   apt update && apt upgrade -y

   # Install Python 3 and pip
   apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git jq

   # Install additional required packages
   apt install -y git openssl curl
   ```

5. Download and Install the Redfish Daemon

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/v1k0d3n/proxmox-redfish.git /opt/proxmox-redfish

   # Create a virtual environment
   cd /opt/proxmox-redfish
   python3 -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install the package
   pip install -e .
   ```

6. Optional (recommended): Generate basic SSL certificates - these can be valid certs, if you want to generate them a different way (below is primarily a working example)

   **WARNING:** *For all you copy/paste warriors out there, be sure to check out the [Administrators Guide](./docs/admins/README.md#ssl-configuration) for better certificate options (including [Let's Encrypt](./docs/admins/README.md#lets-encrypt-certificate-production) options).*
   ```bash
   # Ensure this directory exists - it should already exists
   mkdir -p /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl

   # Generate a self-signed certificate (for testing)
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl/server.key -out /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl/server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=$(hostname)"

   # Set proper permissions
   chmod 600 /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl/server.key
   chmod 644 /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl/server.crt
   ```

7. Configure the proxmox-redfish daemon:

   Create a configuration file:
   ```bash
   # Create the configuration file
   cat > /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/params.env << 'EOF'
   # Proxmox Configuration
   PROXMOX_HOST="YOUR-PROXMOX-API-HOSTNAME-OR-IP"
   PROXMOX_USER="root@pam"
   PROXMOX_PASSWORD="your-proxmox-root-password"
   PROXMOX_API_PORT="8006"
   PROXMOX_NODE=""
   PROXMOX_ISO_STORAGE="local"

   # SSL Configuration
   SSL_CERT_FILE="/opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl/server.crt"
   SSL_KEY_FILE="/opt/proxmox-redfish/config/ssl/server.key"

   # Logging Configuration
   REDFISH_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
   REDFISH_LOGGING_ENABLED="true"
   REDFISH_HOST="0.0.0.0"
   REDFISH_PORT="8443"

   # SSL Verification (for Proxmox API)
   VERIFY_SSL="false"
   EOF
   ```
   **Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your real Proxmox API host and credentials.
   `PROXMOX_HOST` can be any reachable Proxmox cluster node, an API VIP, or a comma-separated list of cluster API hosts for simple failover. `PROXMOX_NODE` is optional and is only used as a fallback if cluster-wide VM lookup is unavailable.
   `PROXMOX_ISO_STORAGE` must point to a Proxmox storage that allows `iso` content; the daemon uploads through the Proxmox API and does not need direct access to `/var/lib/vz`.

7. Create a systemd service unit (so we can run the proxmox-redfish daemon as a service)

   ```bash
   # Create the systemd service file
   cat > /etc/systemd/system/proxmox-redfish.service << 'EOF'
   [Unit]
   Description=Proxmox Redfish Daemon
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=root
   Group=root
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/proxmox-redfish
   EnvironmentFile=/opt/proxmox-redfish/config/params.env
   ExecStart=/opt/proxmox-redfish/venv/bin/python /opt/proxmox-redfish/src/proxmox_redfish/proxmox_redfish.py --port 8000
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOF

   # Ensure the following permissions on the service file
   chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/proxmox-redfish.service

   # Reload systemd and enable the service
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable proxmox-redfish.service --now
   ```

   Set `REDFISH_HOST` to a specific interface address, such as `10.69.42.253`, if you do not want the daemon listening on every interface.

8. Start the service

   ```bash
   # Start the service
   systemctl start proxmox-redfish

   # Check if it's running
   systemctl status proxmox-redfish

   # View the logs
   journalctl -u proxmox-redfish -f
   ```

### Using a Least-Privilege Service Account

For production use, create a dedicated user instead of using root:

1. In the Proxmox web interface
   - Go to "Datacenter" → **Users**
   - Click "Add" → **User**
   - Create a user like `redfish@pam`
   - Set a strong password

2. Update the configuration

   ```bash
   # Edit the configuration file
   vi /opt/proxmox-redfish/config/params.env
   
   # Change these lines:
   PROXMOX_USER="redfish@pam"
   PROXMOX_PASSWORD="your-redfish-user-password"
   ```

3. Restart the service

   ```bash
   systemctl restart proxmox-redfish
   ```

## Advanced Documentation

There are a few guides that users may find useful:
- **For Users**: See the [User Guide](docs/users/README.md) for Redfish API usage
- **For Administrators**: See the [Admin Guide](docs/admins/README.md) for configuration and security
- **For Developers**: See [Contributor Guide](docs/contrib/README.md) for development and testing

## Validation Testing and Troubleshooting

A user-guide has been provided to assist with basic testing and vailidating your deployment. See the [User Guide](docs/users/README.md) for more detail.

### Common Issues

1. **Service won't start**
   ```bash
   # Check the logs
   journalctl -u proxmox-redfish -n 50
   
   # Check if the virtual environment is activated
   ls -la /opt/proxmox-redfish/venv/bin/python
   ```

2. **SSL certificate errors**
   ```bash
   # Regenerate the certificate
   cd /opt/proxmox-redfish
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout config/ssl/server.key -out config/ssl/server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=$(hostname)"
   chmod 600 config/ssl/server.key
   chmod 644 config/ssl/server.crt
   systemctl restart proxmox-redfish
   ```

3. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify your Proxmox credentials in `config/params.env`
   - Check that the user has appropriate permissions
   - Ensure the Proxmox host is accessible

4. **Advanced logging**
   - This project uses a crude Linux logging level to monitor Redfish calls to the daemon process. If you want to change the default logging level the `params.env` file. (example: change `REDFISH_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"` to `REDFISH_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"`).

### Getting Help

- Check the [Admin Guide](docs/admins/README.md) for detailed configuration options
- Review the [User Guide](docs/users/README.md) for API usage examples
- Open an issue on GitHub for bugs or feature requests (I'm always looking for input or new ideas)

## Security Notes

- The daemon runs as root by default for full VM access (you may change this to a [PoLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) model if desired)
- SSL certificates are self-signed by default (you can provide your own valid certificates if desired)
- Consider using a dedicated user with limited permissions (through Roles/Permissions in Proxmox)
- Always keep your Proxmox credentials secure
- Regularly update the daemon and dependencies (as this project matures over time)

## Contributing

I'm definitely looking for feedback and contibutions! Please see the [Contributor Guide](docs/contrib/README.md) for details on how to get started. 

## Background

This project was _heavily_ influenced from project originally started by [jorgeventura](https://github.com/jorgeventura/pve-redfish), but what started out as one script with many remaining gaps turned into something way too large to contribute back. I will however contact the original author and see if there's an opportunity to colaborate going forward, but I felt like I needed to show intent first. I used [Cursor](https://cursor.com/?from=home) to draft the original framework for this project, and as a result, there's quite a bit of work to do in order to make things a bit more clean. But a turn-around of less than 24hrs for something that would take me a month to complete isn't half-bad.
